## Professional expertise

I initially started my programming journey in college by pitching into `C`. Later on, I successively engaged in `Qt/C++`, `ASP.NET/C#`, `PHP/JS/HTML/CSS`, `Android/Java`, `Web/Python`, etc. I worked for some transnational corporations where I mostly wrote server-side code in `C++`/`Java`/`Python`/`Go` along with designing backend and full-stack systems as a systems architect.

For the moment, I primarily play with `Go` and `C`, and I've recently become increasingly interested in `Rust` and have been getting deep into it. Once in a while, I resort to assemblers to get the job done when I have to. I am the creator and current maintainer of [ants](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants) - the most widely used goroutine pool for Go and [gnet](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet) - the fastest and most popular third-party networking framework in Go. In addition to my personal open-source projects, I have also contributed code to many world-renowned open-source projects, such as [golang](https://github.com/golang/go), [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis), [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl), [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent), [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), [istio](https://github.com/istio/istio), [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), etc.

I have a keen interest in [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust), [Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io/), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), Network ([Gnet](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet)/[Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)/[libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)/[libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent)/[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc)/[Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift)/[HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)/[Nginx](https://nginx.org/)/[Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy)/[Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik), etc.), Service Mesh ([Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio)/[Linkerd](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2)/[Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul)/[Maesh](https://github.com/traefik/mesh)), NoSQL ([Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis)/[MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)/[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)/[Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j)/[Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph)/[ArangoDB](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb), etc.), Vector Databases ([Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)/[Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), etc.), AI ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)/[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stablediffusion)/[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), etc.), Web3/Blockchain/Ethereum ([Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)/[Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)/[Fuel](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core), etc.).
