I hereby announce the release of [gnet v2.5.0](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/releases/tag/v2.5.0), where we've added two major features of edge-triggered mode and multiple addresses bindings, along with a good deal of code refactoring and optimizations.

Please visit [Announcing gnet v2.5.0](https://gnet.host/blog/announcing-gnet-v2-5-0/) for more details.
