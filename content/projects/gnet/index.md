## ðŸ“– Introduction

### GitHub

https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet

`gnet` is an event-driven networking framework that is ultra-fast and lightweight. It is built from scratch by exploiting [epoll](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html) and [kqueue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue) and it can achieve much higher performance with lower memory consumption than Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) in many specific scenarios.

`gnet` and [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) don't share the same philosophy about network programming. Thus, building network applications with `gnet` can be significantly different from building them with [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), and the philosophies can't be reconciled. There are other similar products written in other programming languages in the community, such as [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent), [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv), [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty), [twisted](https://github.com/twisted/twisted), [tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado), etc. which work in a similar pattern as `gnet` under the hood.

`gnet` is not designed to displace the Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), but to create an alternative in the Go ecosystem for building performance-critical network services. As a result of which, `gnet` is not as comprehensive as Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/), it provides only the core functionalities (in a concise API set) required by a network application and it doesn't plan on being a coverall networking framework, as I think Go [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) has done a good enough job in that area.

`gnet` sells itself as a high-performance, lightweight, non-blocking, event-driven networking framework written in pure Go which works on the transport layer with TCP/UDP protocols and Unix Domain Socket. It enables developers to implement their own protocols(HTTP, RPC, WebSocket, Redis, etc.) of application layer upon `gnet` for building diversified network services. For instance, you get an HTTP Server if you implement HTTP protocol upon `gnet` while you have a Redis Server done with the implementation of Redis protocol upon `gnet` and so on.

**`gnet` derives from the project: `evio` with much higher performance and more features.**
